        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 text-center mb-4">
          We start by learning about your business with a short questionnaire about your services and goals. From there, we draft a plan for your website or IT needs and share it with you for feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 text-center">
          After your approval, we build the site or set up your systems, typically within 2 to 3 weeks. You’ll get a preview link to see the work before it goes live, and we’ll make any changes to ensure you’re completely satisfied. After the site is live, you'll have access to our team for any support or assistance you may need for as long as you are a customer. We're local and here to help!

              I’m Christopher Fort, the founder of Carolina Coast IT. With a degree in Computer Technology and years of experience in corporate operations, I started this business to help local business owners navigate modern tech with confidence.

            <p class="text-base text-gray-800">
              I focus on clear communication and reliable results, whether I’m building a mobile-friendly website, setting up business email, or solving tech issues. When I’m not working, I’m out on an adventure with my wife, Kelsey, or fishing along the coast, staying connected to the community I live and work with.
